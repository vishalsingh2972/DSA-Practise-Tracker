//How to understand and approach a problem - steps :
// 1) Identify if you can break down the problem into smaller problems.
// 2) Write the recurrence relation if needed.
// 3) Draw the recursive tree.
// 4) About the tree: (points to follow when learning about the tree)
        // See the flow of functions, how they are getting in stack
        // Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
        // Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper
        // Use a debugger to see how the flow is working
// 5) See how the values and what type of values (int, string, etc.) are returned at each step, see where the function call will come out. In the end you will come out of the main function

//âœ¨ðŸŒŸðŸ§¨ VVVVIP ðŸ§¨âœ¨ðŸŒŸ (variables in recursion 1)
// you can have variables in 3 places in recursion - 1) in the arguments 2) in return type 3) in the body of the function
// Example : Binary Search with Recursion ===> recurrence relation is F(N) = O(1) + F(N/2), it means if you want to apply binary search on the array of size N then do a step that takes constant amount of time + search in the half of the array

//âœ¨ðŸŒŸðŸŒ¸ VVVVIP ðŸŒ¸âœ¨ðŸŒŸ (types of recurrence relation)
// 1) Linear recurrence relation - Eg. Fibonacci number
// 2) Divide and conquer recurrence relation (search space is being divided/reduced by a factor) - Eg. Binary search
// so our search space is getting reduced much faster in Divide and conquer RR when compared to Linear RR, hence Divide and conquer RR is much more efficient whereas Linear RR is very inefficient
// Linear RR is very inefficient because it is having multiple duplicate/repeated function calls // this problem can be solved using dynamic programming, dynamic programming means if in the recursion calls two or more recursion calls are doing the same work then don't compute it again and again
